Seems that GitHub is marking the commit as failed ‚ùå  even when build has `continue-on-error: true` Maybe we should add conditional `${{ matrix.allow-fail && '|| true' }}` to the PHPUnit step ü§î

True, but we still require the check to appear as failed, otherwise we'll never spot a new failure (if we fix it later).
At least the workflow run is properly marked as successful.

Ideally, Github should provide something to exclude some checks from the commit.
Or we could update the check conclusion to `neutral`, but it's not allowed neither.

Perhaps only keep the bleeding edges job for PRs, but not on pushes. So we still get a feedback on this job per code change.

Roger that!
BTW, Symfony 5.3 has been released, so we can use `symfony/phpunit-bridge` at `^5.3` üéâ
