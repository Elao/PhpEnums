I've enabled AppVeyor on the repo. It should trigger on new push.

@ogizanagi I think thats it ! There are 3 tests failing but those are also failing on my local machine so i think thats ok.

Congrats 👏
Would you have some time to inspect those tests and attempt to fix it? 🙏

I went through the errors and fixed the test. Unfortunatly i really dislike some of the fixes... Most problems are caused by the directory seperator which is "/" in linux and "\" on windows.
Maybe we can have a short chat on slack or smth before i push those changes.
