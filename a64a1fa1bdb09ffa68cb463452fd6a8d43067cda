Lets wait before merging, I have opened a doctrine issue and I have some idea how this might be fixed on Doctrine level - https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/10432

But we have to see whether its decided to fix there or not.

Hey guys, any chance for merge that? I think we can't depend on doctrine team :(
