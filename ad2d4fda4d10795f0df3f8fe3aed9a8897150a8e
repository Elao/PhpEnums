@ogizanagi this is now complete and ready for review! 🚀

I managed to extract common parts of TypeDumper tests so that we keep them DRY. I also used `readonly` typed properties  instead of phpdocs for stricter type checking.

Sure! Added the readme and rebased on top of recent `2.x` changes to keep the history clean. Cheers!
