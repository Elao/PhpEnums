@ogizanagi can you take a look on this when you're free before I move to the next steps?

Looks great so far. Do you plan to add some integration tests so we can test the implementations against a real ODM, as done for https://github.com/Elao/PhpEnums/blob/master/tests/Integration/Bridge/Doctrine/DBAL/Type/EnumTypeTest.php for instance ?

I will try to ðŸ˜„  The logic behind the types is quite simple but there are many edge cases, it deserves to be tested thoroughly.
I will need to spin off a Mongo container in the CI to test the operations on DB.

@ogizanagi I think this is ready for review - I will add readme instructions for non-bundle usage later today and implement TypesDumper and Bundle integration in a separate PR.

@ogizanagi I managed to add ODM TypeDumper and integrate it with Symfony Bundle. I tested it with one of my existing projects and confirm it is working as expected ðŸš€
I would suggest to split the readme into multiple files in `doc` directory as it becomes really long.

Hi @IonBazan , that's awesome, thanks for your reactivity. I may not be able to review it in the next days though.

I agree about the README.md, and we may rework it later. I might give [Stenope](https://stenopephp.github.io/Stenope/) a chance to generate this doc on Github Pages btw (ðŸ‘€ poke @Tom32i).
